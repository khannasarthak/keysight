### Objective
Creating a UI with drag and drop features to create expressions.

### Technologies used
- JavaScript
- jQuery & jQuery UI
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap

### Assumptions
- Dropping will create new placeholder Divs.
- Functions are available on page load and do not change dynamically.

### Additional Features
- **Clear Screen** : clears the expression area
- **Recursion Depth**: Currently functions are droppable indefinitely, but can be capped by setting the level and depth variables.
